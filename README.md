The Cafe-Connect app is a solution-based application designed for Cafe's franchise managers located all around the UK. Unlike the
previous CSV back-up system, this serverless application allows managers to:  
1. Access real data from over 100 cafe locations;  
2. Identify local and regional customer trends;  
3. Use this information to make informed and impactful decisions.

### _How it Works_:
<img align="right" img src="images/image3.png" width="150" height="150" />

The ETL process **(Extract, Transform, Load)** allows data to be gathered from multiple sources and consolidated into a
single, centralized location. Data has two sources: An S3 Bucket and a Kinesis Data Stream. A CloudWatch Event rule is used to automate the configured ETL process, so that the entire function is triggered daily. <br />
Python Package *boto3* is used to extract raw CSV data from an S3 bucket.<br /> 
The raw data is then transformed and cleaned, using Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to integrate three separate Lamdas.<br />
The Python Package *psycopg2* is used to load this transformed data to a relational Redshift Database.<br />

>> Entire process starts at (time) daily, finishes at (time), taking a total of (time). Costs (Â£)

### _Tests_:

Comprehensive test suite for extract and transform modules runs in under a
second. Easy to run with `pytest` command:

```bash
$ cd team-1-project
$ pytest
```
